# Web-Scraping-and-Data-Analysis
An assignment made in Jupyter Notebook
WebScrapingAndAnalysis.ipynb
In this notebook I have used Jupyter notebook to demonstrate ability to scrape data from websites, as well as format this in a readable format
It also shows ability to display this information and analyse it.


TrendAndPrediction.ipynb
In this notebook I take information from the previous notebook (saved as csv files) and use it to generate predictions and forecasts as to possible future trends.
I used kNN regression to accomplish this.
There is analysis of these predictions also.
